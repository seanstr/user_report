This Ruby script is meant to showcase Ruby code.

This script simply connects to a Joomla MySQL database, runs a time-based query, and saves the data in a CSV file.

For data created by Joomla plugins, the data is often stored in large text column containing JSON data, so there is a section where fields are converted from JSON to flat strings.  Otherwise a very simple script.
